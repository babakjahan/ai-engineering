   "Greece has many islands, with estimates ranging from somewhere around 1,200 to 6,000, "
   "depending on the minimum size to take into account. The number of inhabited islands is "
   "variously cited as between 166 and 227."
   "The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters: the Argo-Saronic Islands "
   "in the Saronic Gulf near Athens; the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central "
   "part of the Aegean Sea; the North Aegean islands, a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey; "
   "the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey; the Sporades, "
   "a small tight group off the coast of Euboea; and the Ionian Islands, chiefly located to the west "
   "of the mainland in the Ionian Sea. Crete with its surrounding islets and Euboea are traditionally "
   "excluded from this grouping."
